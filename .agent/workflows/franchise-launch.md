# Franchise Launch Workflow

This workflow guides you through the process of legally launching a franchise. Springroll Team automates the generation of key documents and compliance checks.

## Phase 1: Disclosure & Preparation

1.  **Generate Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)**
    *   Input: Business history, litigation records, fee structures, and audited financials.
    *   Output: Draft FDD with all 23 items required by the FTC Franchise Rule.
2.  **Draft Franchise Agreement**
    *   Customize the master contract that governs the relationship between you and your franchisees.
3.  **Operations Manual Assembly**
    *   Use the `Operations Manual Template` to document your business systems and processes.

## Phase 2: Branding & Protection

4.  **Trademark Verification & Filing**
    *   Scan the USPTO database for brand conflicts.
    *   Prepare the trademark registration application for the franchise brand.
5.  **IP Audit**
    *   Identify and document trade secrets, logos, and proprietary software to be included in the franchise package.

## Phase 3: State Compliance

6.  **State Registration Selection**
    *   Specify which states you plan to sell franchises in.
    *   Springroll identifies if those are Registration, Filing, or Non-Registration states.
7.  **Generate State-Specific Filings**
    *   Generate the necessary notice filings or registration applications for states like California, New York, or Illinois.

## Phase 4: Execution

8.  **Final Review & Export**
    *   Export the full "Franchise Launch Package" (FDD, Agreement, Manual, and State Filings) for final legal review.
9.  **Initial Franchisee Outreach**
    *   Automate the distribution of the FDD to prospective franchisees (ensuring the 14-day rule compliance).
