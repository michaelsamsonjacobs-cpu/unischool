# GovGrant Autopilot Workflow

This pipeline automates the search, filtering, and drafting of government grant proposals.

## Phase 1: Market Search
*   Query `grants.gov` and `sam.gov` for keywords related to your project.
*   Filter by eligibility (Small Business, Non-Profit, etc.).

## Phase 2: Strategic Assessment
*   Agent analyzes the "Evaluation Criteria" of the RFP.
*   Match your company capabilities to the grant requirements.

## Phase 3: Technical Drafting
*   Draft the project narrative.
*   Generate the budget spreadsheet and justification.

## Phase 4: Compliance Check
*   Verify all required forms (SF-424, etc.) are present.
*   Run agentic review for common disqualifiers.
